# Lunar Apostles

- Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different lunar scav (each scav has different abilities)
- Reward Chances - 40% Green, 30% Pearl, 20% Red, 10% Irradiant Pearl
- Moon is seeded (cauldrons will be the same)
- Chests/Forms will not appear after completing a pillar
- The scavs don't have items
- Prevents drones from going to the scav arena (droneman, beetleguard, zoea, empathy cores still work)
