# Lunar Apostles

- Makes pillars optional and each pillar takes you to fight a different lunar scav (each scav has different abilities)
- Reward Chances - 40% Green, 30% Pearl, 15% Red, 10% Irradiant Pearl
- Moon is seeded (cauldrons will be the same)
- The scavs don't have items
- Prevents drones from going to the scav arena (droneman, beetleguard, zoea, empathy cores still work)

TODOs

- hook into scav states and switch based on pillar activated
- write all entity states
